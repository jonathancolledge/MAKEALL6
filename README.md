# MAKEALL6
A batch file to make all 6 man endgame tablebases for Chessmaster using the FEG version 3.03c</br>
Ensure that you have generated all the 3,4, and 5 man tablebases.
Put this batch file in your FEG folder (ensure your drive has enough space - I'm not sure how muchj is needed, but a few Tb should suffice).
Then run the batch file and leave your computer on for about a month and a half.
